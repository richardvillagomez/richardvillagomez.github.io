## Research

My research interests lie in finding ways to make computing and data science education more equitable and accessible, especially for students from underrepresented communities and nontraditional backgrounds. I hope to help contribute to CS education through exploratory research in the computing classroom, building pathways for all students to achieve computational literacy.
