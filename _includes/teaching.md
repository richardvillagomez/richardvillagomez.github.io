## Teaching

I’ve been a teaching assistant for lower-division data science courses at UC Berkeley since Summer 2024, the summer after my sophomore year. I’m passionate about expanding access to the computing classroom, and practicing inclusion through pedagogical practices and culturally responsive curriculum. I believe inclusion means more than just helping students feel comfortable in the classroom—but finding ways to ensure that they recognize they truly belong in the field.

Most recently, I was the head teaching assistant for [Data 6: Introduction to Computational Thinking with Data](https://data6.org/fa25/), funded through an NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) grant. The course was designed primarily for social students and emphasizes rigorous computational problem-solving to prepare students for computational social science research and advanced computer science coursework. I contributed to curriculum development and instruction across topics including Python fundamentals (iteration, conditionals, functions), data visualizations, table manipulation, HTML web scraping, API usage, and qualitative coding.

Before then, I was a teaching assistant for [Data 8: Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data8.org/), which teaches core data science concepts across statistical inference, data analysis, and computational thinking through Python and the pandas-based [datascience](https://www.data8.org/datascience/) library. Data 8 is the first course where I felt capable of success as a programmer, and I'm grateful to have had the privilege of teaching hundreds of students in my discussion sections and helping them recognize their potential and ultimately see themselves as data scientists. 

I make all my teaching materials public! Here are my [teaching materials](https://richardvillagomez.notion.site/data8-su25) from the Summer 2025 iteration of Data 8.
