## Teaching

I’ve been a teaching assistant for lower-division data science courses at UC Berkeley since Summer 2024, the summer after my sophomore year. I’m passionate about expanding access to the computing classroom, and practicing inclusion through pedagogical practices and culturally responsive curriculum. I believe inclusion means more than just helping students feel comfortable in the classroom—but finding ways to ensure that they recognize they truly belong in the field.

Most recently, I was the head teaching assistant for [Data 6: Introduction to Computational Thinking with Data](https://data6.org/fa25/). I contributed to instruction and curriculum development across topics including Python fundamentals (iteration, conditionals, functions), data visualizations, table manipulation, HTML web scraping, API usage, and qualitative coding. 

Before then, I was a teaching assistant for [Data 8: Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data8.org/), which teaches core data science concepts across statistical inference, data analysis, and computational thinking through Python and the pandas-based [datascience](https://www.data8.org/datascience/) library. Data 8 is the course that made me feel like I was capable of success as a programmer, and I’ve had the privilege of teaching hundreds of students in my discussion sections and helping them discover the beauty of data science. 

I make all my teaching materials public! Here are my [teaching materials](https://richardvillagomez.notion.site/data8-su25) from the Summer 2025 iteration of Data 8.
