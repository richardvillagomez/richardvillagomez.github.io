## About

I’m Richard, a fourth-year undergraduate from the island of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, studying Computer Science and Data Science at UC Berkeley.

I’m passionate about expanding accessibility to computing and data science education. I’ve previously been a part of Algorithms & Computing for Education (ACE) Lab, doing research on integrating Human Contexts & Ethics (HCE) into data science curriculum. 

This fall, I will be the Head Undergraduate Instructor for Data 6: Introduction to Computational Thinking with Data. The course focuses on teaching Python and computer science fundamentals, data visualization tools, and computational social science—specifically for social scientists. My role involves building curriculum on topics such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and ethics in data visualizations.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking around the Bay Area, playing fingerstyle guitar, and exploring graphic design through Adobe software.
