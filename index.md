## About

I’m a fourth-year undergraduate from the island of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, studying Computer Science and Data Science at UC Berkeley. 

This past semester, I was the Head Undergraduate Instructor for Data 6: Introduction to Computational Thinking with Data. The course focuses on teaching Python and computer science fundamentals, data visualization tools, and computational social science. My role involved leading weekly discussion sections, and building curriculum on topics such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and ethics in data visualizations.

My research interests lie in finding ways to make computing and data science education more equitable and accessible. I hope to help improve CS education through exploratory research in the computing classroom, ultimately expanding computational literacy for everyone, regardless of their field of study.
