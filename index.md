## About

Hi! I’m a fourth-year undergraduate student from the island of [Saipan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saipan,_Northern_Mariana_Islands) in the [Northern Mariana Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mariana_Islands), studying Computer Science and Data Science at UC Berkeley.

I'm passionate about finding ways to make computing and data science education more equitable and accessible. I discovered my passion for computing education through my position as an undergraduate teaching assistant for [Data 8: Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data8.org/) (UC Berkeley's largest course!), teaching weekly discussion sections across core data science topics using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

I also organize as a proud member of [UAW Local 4811](https://www.uaw4811.org/), the union of academic workers at the University of California. I’m currently in my eighth semester as an academic worker, and I've experienced firsthand the importance of having a strong union in maintaining the quality of instruction that students deserve.
