## About

Hi! I’m a fourth-year undergraduate student from the island of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, studying Computer Science and Data Science at UC Berkeley. 

This past semester, I was the Head Undergraduate Instructor for [Data 6: Introduction to Computational Thinking with Data](https://data6.org/fa25/). The course focuses on teaching Python and computer science fundamentals, data visualization tools, and computational social science. I contributed to instruction and curriculum development across topics including Python fundamentals (iteration, conditionals, functions), data visualizations, table manipulation, HTML web scraping, API usage, and qualitative coding.

I also organize as a proud member of [UAW Local 4811](https://www.uaw4811.org/), the union of academic workers at the University of California. I’ve been an academic worker for [Data 8: Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data8.org/) (UC Berkeley's largest course!) for seven semesters, and I've experienced firsthand the importance of winning and enforcing a strong union contract—including fair wages and workload protections—in maintaining the quality of instruction that students deserve.
