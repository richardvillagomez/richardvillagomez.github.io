## About

I’m a fourth-year undergraduate student from the island of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, studying Computer Science and Data Science at UC Berkeley. 

This past semester, I was the Head Undergraduate Instructor for [Data 6: Introduction to Computational Thinking with Data](https://data6.org/fa25/). The course focuses on teaching Python and computer science fundamentals, data visualization tools, and computational social science. I contributed to instruction and curriculum development across topics including Python fundamentals (iteration, conditionals, functions), data visualizations, table manipulation, HTML web scraping, API usage, and qualitative coding.

My research interests lie in finding ways to make computing and data science education more equitable and accessible, especially for students from underrepresented communities and nontraditional backgrounds. I hope to help contribute to CS education through exploratory research in the computing classroom, building pathways for all students to achieve computational literacy.

I also organize as a proud member of [UAW Local 4811](https://www.uaw4811.org/), the union of academic workers at the University of California. I’ve been an academic worker for [Data 8: Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data8.org/) (UC Berkeley's largest course!) for seven semesters, and I've experienced firsthand the importance of winning and enforcing a strong union contract—including fair wages and workload protections—in maintaining the quality of instruction that students deserve.
